## Summary
**Goal:** Restore the site header and footer on all public-facing pages of the Ceiling Pro website.

**Planned changes:**
- Re-add the SiteHeader component to the homepage (/) and account page (/account), displaying the logo/brand link, Account button, and click-to-call phone button (9834587806), sticky at the top, with the Admin entry hidden from public users.
- Re-add the SiteFooter component to the homepage (/) and account page (/account), displaying company info, phone number (9834587806), email (ceilingpro9@gmail.com), services list, and copyright, without any GST label or placeholder.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors to the homepage and account page will see the full header navigation at the top and the complete footer at the bottom on both mobile and desktop screen sizes.
