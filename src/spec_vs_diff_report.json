  "summary": "REQ-26 appears implemented by changing default admin credentials in backend/main.mo and adding a migration (backend/migration.mo) wired via `(with migration = Migration.run)` to force persisted credentials to the new values on upgrade. REQ-27 appears implemented by updating the shared config email to ceilingpro9@gmail.com. REQ-28 appears implemented by restoring default service-card image paths to /images/service1.jpg..service4.jpg in both backend defaults and frontend service definitions, plus frontend hook defaults.",
